# Light-Active-Switch
Arduino analog read and light active switch

Light Switch
Is an Arduino project in which we construct a circuit that can be activated by shining a light on the sensor.
It incorporates a photoresistor sensor (KLS6-3537), an n3904 transistor switch and a 555 timer monostable. The signal propagates through the circuit and the arduino uno detects and plots the signal change at each stage.
